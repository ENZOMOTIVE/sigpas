## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Multisignature NFT Wallet project. This groundbreaking solution introduces a new concept in NFT management and verification, leveraging multisignature technology to enhance security and trust in digital asset systems.

## Project Overview

The Multisignature NFT Wallet is a cutting-edge application designed to securely store, manage, and transfer Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) using a multisignature approach. It utilizes advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure the highest level of security and integrity for users' digital assets.

Key Features:
- Secure storage of NFTs
- Multisignature verification process for NFT transfers
- User-friendly interface for NFT management
- Support for NFT creation, transfer, and verification

## Multisignature NFT Concept

The Multisignature NFT concept is a novel approach in the context of digital asset management. This innovation combines the uniqueness and non-fungibility of NFTs with the enhanced security of multisignature technology.

### How it works:

1. **Multiple Signatures**: Instead of using a single private key to sign and transfer NFTs, the system requires multiple signatures.

2. **Threshold Signing**: A predefined number of signatures (threshold) is required to validate an NFT transfer or modification.

3. **Distributed Ownership**: By requiring multiple parties to sign, ownership and control of the NFT can be distributed among several entities.

4. **Enhanced Security**: This approach significantly increases security by making it much harder for an attacker to compromise the NFT.

5. **Flexible Governance**: Allows for various governance models for NFT management, such as multi-party ownership or requiring approval from designated authorities.

## Current Implementation with ERC721

In the current version of the Multisignature NFT Wallet, we are using the ERC721 standard as a foundation for our implementation. ERC721 is the most widely adopted standard for NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Adapting ERC721 for Multisignature:

1. **Extended Metadata**: We've extended the standard ERC721 metadata to include fields for multiple signatures and the signing threshold.

2. **Modified Transfer Function**: The transfer function (`transferFrom`) has been modified to require multiple signatures before executing.

3. **Signature Verification**: A new function has been added to verify the validity and number of signatures before any transfer.

4. **Signature Storage**: Signatures are stored off-chain to reduce gas costs, with only a hash of the combined signatures stored on-chain.

## Workflow

The workflow of the Multisignature NFT Wallet can be broken down into several key processes:

1. **NFT Creation**
   - User initiates NFT creation
   - Multiple authorized signers apply their signatures
   - The multisigned NFT is minted and added to the wallet

2. **NFT Storage**
   - NFT is stored securely in the wallet
   - Wallet maintains a record of all stored NFTs and their signature requirements

3. **NFT Transfer**
   - User initiates a transfer
   - Required signers are notified
   - Each signer reviews and signs the transfer
   - If the threshold is met, the NFT is transferred to the new owner

4. **Verification Process**
   - Verifier checks the NFT's signatures
   - If the required threshold of valid signatures is met, the NFT's authenticity is confirmed

## Technical Implementation

[Technical implementation details remain largely the same as in the previous version]

## Security Considerations

[Security considerations remain largely the same as in the previous version]

## Future Enhancements

[Previous future enhancements remain, with the following addition:]

6. **New ERC Token Standard**: Development of a new ERC token standard specifically designed for Multisignature NFTs, improving efficiency and expanding capabilities.

## Roadmap for New ERC Token

As part of our commitment to innovation and improving the Multisignature NFT ecosystem, we are planning to develop a new ERC token standard specifically designed for Multisignature NFTs. This new standard will build upon the lessons learned from our current ERC721-based implementation and introduce native support for multisignature operations.

Key features of the planned ERC token:

1. **Native Multisignature Support**: Built-in functions for managing multiple signatures and thresholds.

2. **Gas Optimization**: Improved efficiency in storing and verifying multiple signatures.

3. **Flexible Governance Models**: Support for various multisignature schemes (e.g., n-of-m signatures, weighted signatures).

4. **Interoperability**: Ensuring compatibility with existing NFT marketplaces and wallets while offering enhanced features for multisignature-aware platforms.

5. **Standardized Events**: New events for multisignature-specific actions to improve traceability and integration with other systems.

We are currently in the planning phase for this new ERC token and will be engaging with the Ethereum community to gather feedback and ensure the standard meets the needs of the broader ecosystem.
